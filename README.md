### Apartment_Web_Scraper
  Everyone understands the difficultly of finding an apartment in Berlin. Having recently been through this ordeal myself, I was inspired to use my new coding skill to solve my own problem. This a small project to explore how I could build a python app that allowed me to scrape apartment listing info from websites like wg-gesucht.com 
  
  I plan to build one functionality at a time. 
    1. The first part of the project was to build a webscraper.
    2. The second part of the project: a function sending an email with the relevant listings to myself once a week
    3. The final part: a python function drafting an message to potential landlords.
